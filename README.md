## Fundamentals

The folder called `Fundamentals` contains code that is copied and modified from a open source project created by the author called [Cratis](https://github.com/aksio-insurtech/Cratis).
If you want to leverage the code provided by Cratis and don't want to maintain the code yourself, Cratis outputs packages that can be used.
